# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Setup SKILL.md synced with v1.7.0**: the setup skill now generates CLAUDE.md instructions matching the current v1.7.0 spec, including SRS review block format, SRS Protocol (SM-2 algorithm), trigger priority rules, session upsert, and Korean flag
- **SRS Schedule section**: added to the markdown template generated by setup, matching the regeneration format used by ambient coaching

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **SRS activation**: SM-2 spaced repetition scheduling for pattern reviews. After a correction, the pattern is scheduled for review. Correct usage extends the interval; re-errors reset it. Patterns resolve when interval reaches 21+ days with 5+ consecutive correct usages.
- **SRS review block**: new lightweight coaching block format (`💭`) for scheduled reviews. Lower priority than corrections and teaching. Max 1 per response.
- **Session auto-tracking**: every coaching interaction (correction, teaching, correct usage, SRS review) automatically upserts a session entry in the coaching JSON. Sessions tracked by date with project context.
- **Session entry schema**: `date`, `project`, `patterns_addressed`, `new_patterns`, `patterns_correct`, `srs_reviews`, `vocabulary_taught`, `notes`
- **SRS Schedule section** in markdown regeneration showing upcoming reviews with interval and ease factor
- **README refresh**: feature matrix for 7 languages, SRS and session tracking sections, architecture explanation, updated contributing guide

### Changed
- CLAUDE.md coaching instructions expanded with SRS review protocol, session tracking, SRS review block format (~83 lines total)
- `language-coaching` SKILL.md updated with full SM-2 algorithm specification, SRS review triggering logic, session auto-tracking upsert protocol
- `lang` SKILL.md session writing now merges with ambient session data instead of overwriting
- `setup` SKILL.md confirmation mentions SRS and session tracking
- Hook nudge message includes session tracking and SRS review awareness
- Contributing guide shifted from "add templates" to "refinement/features" focus

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **German language template**: JSON + Markdown coaching memory templates with German-specific sections (cases, gender with 3 genders, word order V2 rule, compound nouns, Umlaut spelling)
- **Japanese language template**: JSON + Markdown coaching memory templates with Japanese-specific sections (particles は/が, keigo honorifics, writing system, counters, pitch accent)
- **Korean language template**: JSON + Markdown coaching memory templates with Korean-specific sections (particles 은/는 vs 이/가, honorific speech levels, Hangul spelling with 받침, verb endings)
- **German review format**: session review block with cases, gender & articles, word order, pronunciation sections
- **Japanese review format**: session review block with particles, keigo, writing system, pronunciation sections
- **Korean review format**: session review block with particles, honorifics, Hangul spelling, pronunciation sections
- **Pronunciation reference tables**: pt-BR → German (15 sound mappings), pt-BR → Japanese (9 sound mappings), pt-BR → Korean (11 sound mappings)
- **Pronunciation traps**: pt-BR → German (Umlauts, ch sounds, final devoicing, compound stress), pt-BR → Japanese (pitch accent, vowel length, geminate consonants), pt-BR → Korean (three-way consonant distinction, ㅓ/ㅗ, 받침 rules, consonant assimilation)
- Keywords `german`, `japanese`, `korean` added to plugin.json
- All 7 planned language templates now complete (en, es, fr, it, de, ja, ko)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **French language template**: JSON + Markdown coaching memory templates with French-specific sections (gender, verb conjugation, prepositions, liaison/nasal vowel pronunciation notes)
- **Italian language template**: JSON + Markdown coaching memory templates with Italian-specific sections (double consonants, gender, essere/avere auxiliary, congiuntivo, open/closed vowels)
- **French review format**: session review block in `/lang` skill with grammar, gender, false friends, pronunciation, prepositions sections
- **Italian review format**: session review block in `/lang` skill with grammar, spelling & double consonants, false friends, pronunciation, verb conjugation sections
- **Pronunciation reference tables**: pt-BR → French (12 sound mappings) and pt-BR → Italian (14 sound mappings) in `language-coaching` skill
- **Pronunciation traps**: pt-BR → French (nasal vowels, "u" /y/, silent finals, liaison, stress) and pt-BR → Italian (double consonants, open/closed vowels, affricates, no nasalization, gemination)
- Keywords `french` and `italian` added to plugin.json

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **UserPromptSubmit hook**: injects a coaching nudge on every user prompt, reminding Claude to check for language patterns and provide coaching blocks. This ensures ambient coaching fires reliably.
- **Condensed coaching instructions for CLAUDE.md**: the `/setup` skill now writes both the config YAML and a `# Language Coaching Instructions` section (~45 lines) to CLAUDE.md. These instructions are always in Claude's context, enabling true ambient coaching.
- **Upgrade path**: existing users with pre-v1.4.0 config can run `/setup` to add the instructions section without re-entering their preferences.

### Changed
- **Architecture**: ambient coaching no longer relies solely on the `language-coaching` skill being invoked. The primary mechanism is now CLAUDE.md instructions (always in context) + UserPromptSubmit hook (reinforcement on every prompt). The full `language-coaching` SKILL.md remains as a detailed reference for schemas and pronunciation tables.
- Setup skill confirmation step now mentions the hook and recommends starting a new session for it to take effect.

### Fixed
- Ambient coaching not firing despite correct configuration (root cause: `user-invocable: false` skills only load their one-line description into context, not the full SKILL.md instructions)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Typo exception was too broad, causing Claude to skip corrections for missing apostrophes ("im") and lowercase language names ("english")
- Coaching block delimiters now enforce spacing between flag emoji and language name
- Removed invalid `category` and `tags` fields from plugin.json that caused manifest validation error

### Changed
- Coaching blocks now use framed card format with backtick-wrapped delimiters for clear visual separation
- Active teaching blocks are more compact: term + pronunciation on one line, false friend merged into note line
- Added README badges, GitHub issue/PR templates, CI validation workflow, and CONTRIBUTING.md

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Pronunciation coaching**: every active teaching block now includes a 🔊 line with phonetic approximation using the user's native language sounds
- Pronunciation Guidelines section in ambient skill with format rules, generation process, and sound mapping tables
- Reference mapping tables for pt-BR speakers (English and Spanish target languages)
- Pronunciation trap documentation (pt-BR → English, pt-BR → Spanish, plus guidance for other native languages)
- `pronunciation` field in Vocabulary Object Schema (string, nullable)
- Pronunciation section in session review output (`/lang`) for both English and Spanish formats
- Pronunciation Notes section in coaching memory markdown templates
- Legacy vocabulary backfill: session review generates pronunciation for pre-v1.3.0 entries missing the field

### Changed
- Active Teaching Block format now includes 🔊 line after term introduction
- Markdown regeneration includes pronunciation in vocabulary listing
- Pronunciation system is native-language-aware (adapts to configured `native_language`, not hardcoded)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Configurable `mode` per language: `corrective`, `active`, or `both` (default)
- Setup skill asks for coaching mode during interactive configuration
- Mode descriptions in setup: corrective (fix mistakes), active (teach from context), both (recommended)

### Changed
- Activation logic checks `mode` field to determine which coaching modes are enabled per language
- Config example updated to show `mode` field
- Smart defaults include `mode: both` when not specified

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Active Teaching Mode**: proactively teaches target language vocabulary from conversation context, even when user writes in another language
- Full micro-lesson block format: translation, part of speech, contextual sentence, grammar note, false friend warning
- Vocabulary Object Schema with tracking (times shown, times used by user, false friend warnings)
- Active teaching memory protocol (vocabulary entries persisted in JSON, rendered in markdown)
- Selection criteria for teaching terms: false friend traps > domain verbs > technical nouns > expressions > general
- Dual-mode coaching: corrections AND active teaching run simultaneously, both controlled by intensity level

### Changed
- Intensity levels now define frequency for both correction and active teaching
- Activation section rewritten to describe corrective mode and active teaching mode separately
- Trigger rules split into Correction Triggers and Active Teaching Triggers
- Markdown regeneration includes richer vocabulary section (examples, false friend warnings, usage counts)
- Key Principles expanded: contextual relevance, avoid vocabulary flooding

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Pattern IDs now enforced as typed slugs (`grammar-didnt-plus-past`) instead of integers
- SRS fields (`next_review`, `interval_days`, `ease_factor`) and positive tracking fields (`times_correct_since_last_error`, `last_correct_usage`) now required in every pattern entry
- False friends must go in `patterns` array with `type: "false_friend"` — no separate `false_friends` key allowed
- Added explicit Pattern Object Schema to ambient coaching skill
- Setup and lang skills reference canonical schema for consistency
